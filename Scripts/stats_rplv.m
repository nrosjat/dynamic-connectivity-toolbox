%------------- Script for statistical analysis of (r)PLV ------------------

% 
% Inputs:
%   subjects - list of ids
%   options -multiple_conds, baseline, freqs, switch_hands, channels_new,
%   channels_old, contrast, contrast_conds, averaging, avg_freqs
%
%   data - dimensions (elecs, freqs, time, conditions)
%
% Outputs:
%   sig_ti_FDR - significant timepoints after statistics - cell [channel, channel]
%   xa -cell [channel, channel], each channel pair contains a list of 
%           significant intervals [#intervals, 3] - start, stop, timepoints
%           gap to next interval
%   lengths - length - cell [channel, channel], each channel pair contains a
%         list of length of intervals
